    "In this notebook, I will walk through my thought process as I attempt to classify a data set of X-Ray images from patients (primarily children) with and without pneumonia through machine learning methods. The study from which the original dataset comes from can be found here: https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30154-5.\n",

    "The goal is to determine, based only on these images, if the patient has viral, bacterial or no pneumonia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of this paper took a different approach than I to solve this problem - utilizing transfer learning and applying pre-trained models to this data. However, as I have been practicing my skills in Pytorch, I decided it would be more useful to me if I construct and train my own model for this set.\n",

While doctors can often diagnose pneumonia through x-rays and bloodwork, I thought it might be an interesting application of machine learning and could prove useful when doctors are not available to interpret the data. Further, distinguishing between the types of pneumonia could be especially helpful since viral and bacterial pneunomia exhibit many of the same symptoms but require different treatments.\n",

    "As I tried adding more layers, the time in which the model took to train became too much to justify the marginal improvements in accuracy. Instead, I turned my focus to optimizing the performance of this model. In the above figures, I used an adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001. The adam optimizer is perfect for getting a quick understanding of how the model performs (as long as the learning rate is reasonable) but often has a lower accuracy than stochastic gradient descent. Because of this, once I had found a structure I was happy with, I swapped over to SGD for my optimizer. Using a learning rate of 0.001 the previous model generated the following figures with SGD:\n",

However, I wanted to try a model structure that has been proven to work well for image classification yet is still not too complicated.

An instance where this may be useful is the global shortage of testing kits for COVID-19. If a model such as this one could be applied to help diagnose patients, they would only need an xray instead (though it may just end up in xray shortages)."
